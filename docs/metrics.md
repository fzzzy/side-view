# Side View Metrics

Metrics collections and analysis plan for Side View as part of the [Firefox Test Pilot program](https://testpilot.firefox.com).

## Analysis

Data collected in this experiment will be used to answer the following high-level questions:

* How often do users load a non-homepage in the sidebar?
* Are people who use Side View heavy tab users?



## Collection
Data will be collected with Google Analytics and follow [Test Pilot standards](https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/docs/experiments/ga.md) for reporting.

## Custom Metrics
*none*

### Custom Dimensions

* `cd1` - The width of the sidebar in pixels.  An integer
* `cd2` - The number of open tabs across all windows.  An integer
* `cd3` - The site type requested.  One of `desktop` or `mobile`
* `cd4` - The length of the list the user interacted with.  Used for open and recent tab lists.  An integer
